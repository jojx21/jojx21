- 👀 I’m interested in finacial or data analytical things and coding them with python and in fututre in c++.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and after grasping more in depth ideas I will begin to leaarn c++ in order to use them both in tandum.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything simple for now as I am a beginner so I'm not sure what to expect.
- 📫 How to reach me on GitHub if possible or ask fir my email as I'm not sure how this works yet.
